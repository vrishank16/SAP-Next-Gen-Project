# SAP-Next-Gen-Project

I am currently working on a project wherein me and my team are building a UI (using SAP Build) which will be implemented across all Telstra payphone screens in Melbourne. This UI is being built with the aim of helping homeless people navigate through life on the streets.

### Introduction

Homelessness is perhaps one of the more prevailing issues within urban environments in the 21st century that has no concrete solutions as of yet. There are two key mediating factors that invoke the unpleasant situation of being homeless; structural factors and individual risk factors (salvationarmy, 2024). Structural factors include facets such as cost of living, poverty, unemployment and lack of government support. Individual factors such as mental illness, trauma, institutionalisation and addiction interact with these structural factors to invoke homelessness. 
A census performed by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare indicate that the number of homeless individuals in Victoria amount to nearly 100,000 (AIHW, 2024) This number translates to every 1 in 67 people residing in Victoria being homeless. 
Homeless individuals may not have proper access nor ability (due to individual factors) to improve their quality of life. The following project aims at improving quality of life of homeless individuals by consolidating some of the online services they require into the payphones in Australia. 

### Aims and Objectives
The proposed project aims to provide easy access to key necessities for the homeless communities utilising the payphones located within Australia that will enable users to access preset online features. These payphones will act as go-to stations for the homeless to access basic services and get help if and when required. A total of 9 online services have been proposed which aim at helping the homeless meet their physiological, safety and security needs. 
These features have been proposed based on the core principles of Maslowâ€™s Hierarchical needs (Nordberg, A. et al., 2024). One of the primary and most necessary needs for the homeless is to find shelter, food, water, clothing and basic safety and the proposed interface would provide users to access these services with the click of a button. This interface will also allow them to accomplish tasks that would be difficult without access to a smartphone or the internet. These will include accessing healthcare information, financial services and a platform to apply for jobs directly. The vision of this project is to make the lives of the homeless a little easier and hassle-free as they try and find ways to survive.


#### Note: 
The project is still ongoing and the final UI is not complete yet. For now, the project plan has been attached which includes the scope, methodology, budget and timeline.
